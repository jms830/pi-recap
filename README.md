**Never scroll back to remember what you were doing.**

An always-visible session recap panel for [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) showing the current goal and last few conversation turns with live streaming updates.

## Features

- **Auto-derived session goal** — the title updates automatically after the first turn using a fast LLM
- **Turn history** — last 4 recaps with timestamps, speaker tags (`you` / `pi`), and fade-to-dim for older entries
- **Live streaming** — breathing dot while thinking, caret blink during token arrival, 180ms settle animation on completion
- **Keyboard navigation** — `Ctrl+Shift+R` to focus, `↑↓` to scroll older entries, `Esc` to release
- **Slash commands** — `/recap` opens the unified menu (pick summarization model, set goal, rename title, free-only auto-pick toggle, blacklist controls)
- **Theme-agnostic text colors** — recap headline and body use hardcoded high-contrast colors that work on any theme (light or dark)
- **Cheap summarization** — auto-selects the fastest/cheapest available model (flash/mini/haiku/turbo) to keep costs near zero. Free-only auto-pick mode restricts automatic fallbacks to auth-ready zero-cost models.

## Installation

Pi auto-discovers extensions from `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`. Clone the repo there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fornace/pi-recap.git ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-recap
cd ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-recap
npm install
```

Restart pi. The recap panel appears above the editor after your first message.

## Usage

The panel is passive — it just shows the last few turns. No configuration needed.

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Shift+R` | Focus the recap panel |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate older entries (while focused) |
| `Esc` | Release focus |

### Slash commands

Type `/recap` for the interactive menu. No arguments needed — everything is selection-based.

| Menu path | Description |
|---|---|
| `/recap` → **goal: ...** | Set/override the recap widget goal (text input) |
| `/recap` → **clear goal** | Remove override, return to auto-derivation |
| `/recap` → **session title: auto-renames / recap-only** | Toggle whether auto-derived goals rename the host session title |
| `/recap` → **auto-pick cost: standard / free-only** | Toggle whether automatic fallbacks may use paid models |
| `/recap` → **model: ...** | Pick from available fast models (select list) |
| `/recap` → **clear model** | Remove model override |
| `/recap` → **Display: full card / footer marker / compact line** | Choose the recap surface: full card above the editor, a terse footer marker (full recap in the terminal title), or a compact one-line widget |
| `/recap` → **blacklist: N entries** → **view / add / remove / reset / re-seed** | Manage the model skip-list |

### Model picker chain

The summarization model is selected through a 4-layer chain (top wins):

1. **User override** — set via `/recap` → **model**; explicit override wins even in free-only auto mode
2. **Cached winner** — 24h TTL from last successful run
3. **Curated chain** — fast/cheap models imported from [pi-bench](https://github.com/fornace/pi-bench), ordered by bench rank
4. **Session model** — pi's configured model (sacred fallback, never blacklisted)

When free-only auto-pick is enabled, layers 2-4 are filtered to zero-cost models with configured auth.

## Development

```bash
cd ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-recap
npm install        # types + typescript
npx tsc            # type-check (no emit, jiti loads .ts directly)
```

Pi loads `.ts` files via jiti — no build step needed during development.

### Testing

```bash
npx tsx test-recap.ts            # test recap/goal generation with mock registry
npx tsx test-recap-models.ts     # test model picker chain against real registry
```

## Changelog

### 0.8.16

- Fixed double-render of the recap panel during pi-tui startup. The widget now registers on first user input (`before_agent_start`) instead of `session_start`, preventing the panel from appearing twice when pi first launches.
- Added raw Enter keypress listener via `onTerminalInput` to bump the decoy row at the earliest possible moment, before pi processes the submit. This gives maximum time for the decoy to clear orphaned border fragments in scrollback. The listener skips when the recap widget has focus and never consumes the keypress.
